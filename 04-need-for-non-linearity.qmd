# Need for non-linearity

Generate three linear relationships that combine into a non-monotonic one.
```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)

nonlinear_data <- dplyr::bind_rows(
  tibble(x = 1:5, y = rnorm(5, 6 * x, sd = 0.5), label = "A"),
  tibble(x = 6:20, y = rnorm(15, 36 + -1 * x, sd = 0.5), label = "B"),
  tibble(x = 21:25, y = rnorm(5, 36 - 21 + 2 * (x - 21), sd = 0.5), label = "C")
)

ggplot(nonlinear_data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```

There is no good way to fit this relationship using a single linear model. But what if we fit _three_ linear models in the hidden layer?

```{r}


```
